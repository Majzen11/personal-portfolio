# Personal Portfolio
Roadmap.sh Personal Portfolio project

Project-URL: https://roadmap.sh/projects/portfolio-website

## URL for final project:
https://majzen11.github.io/personal-portfolio/

## Key requirements for this project:

The goal of this project is to teach you how to style a website using CSS. In this project, you will style the HTML website structure you created previously in a different project. The focus will be on learning how to use CSS to create responsive layouts, apply color and typography, and enhance the overall design of your website.

Do not worry about the design details i.e. colors backgrounds etc at this stage; we are not looking for a beautiful design, but a well-structured and responsive website. Just focus on making the layout same as the mockup and ensuring it looks good on different screen sizes.

Your submission should include:

- A fully styled, responsive website with the same structure as the previous project.
- Consistent use of a chosen color scheme and typography.
- Proper use of CSS techniques like Flexbox, media queries, and the box model.
- A responsive navigation bar and well-styled contact form.

For bonus points, you can:

- Use Google Fonts to enhance the typography of your website.
- Look into GitHub Pages or Cloudflare Pages to host your website for free.
- Add support for dark mode using CSS variables.

## My thoughts on this project

- I really enjoyed working on this project. I find it a hard to avoid thinking about the design details as I really like that part of frontend design. I did feel like the project requirements left it a bit up to me how I wanted to style the page as long as I kept the layout pretty close to the mock-up. 
- I've learned a bit about using flexbox and grid, though I have a lot left to learn, as this was a very simple use of them.
- I've learned about creating forms and the accessibility connected to them. I feel forms are a bit strange to make when they don't actually do anything. They're missing quite a lot. But that's a lesson for another day.
- I've read about the best ways to structure your css documents to keep them organised, for example by creating logical sections in the stylesheet. I don't know if I've actually managed this well, but I've tried a little bit at least. The document does get very long when there's so many elements to style. And this isn't even a very big website. I can imagine how important it will be for larger projects. This article is useful on this: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Organizing
- I've learned about using more general selectors in order to make styling larger projects easier.
- I've learned about how to make your website support both dark and light mode. I originally chose a dark colour theme because I feel that works quite well for a portfolio website. However, this gave me some issues when I got to the "support for dark mode"-part of the assignment. This was optional to do, but I wanted to do it to learn. Because my site was already dark, I had to make a light mode option instead. This wasn't really a probblem in itself, but I really liked my dark design and I didn't feel like the light version gave it justice. I suppose I could have gone with different colours completely for the light mode, but I wanted it to fit with the logo. It doesn't look great, but at least I learned something new! I wish there was a way to make your dark mode the default when someone goes on your site, no matter their pre-chosen options. Then they could change it if they want light mode. I do want my site to accessible for those who need light mode, but I also want my choice of design to be the first thing people see. Take myself as an example, I often prefer light mode, because I'm more used to that, so I have that as the default setting, but I don't necessarily need it. I'd still like to see a dark website first, if that was the designer's intention. I suppose if it's really important that the website be dark, you don't have to provide the accessibility, but that doesn't seem like a greta option.
- I wanted to make the header fixed, so that it's always visible when you scroll, but I ended up scrapping that idea and leaving it for a later project. I tried a little bit, but it changed the whole positioning of the header and I just didn't want to work on that any more at that point. I think I could have done it if I had started with that earlier in the project when I was more motivated.
